## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to dpm. It's people
like you that make dpm such a great tool.

### Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [create an issue](https://github.com/patch-tech/dpm/issues)! It's
generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

If you have a general question about dpm or have an idea that's not quite ready for a formal feature request, you can create a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/patch-tech/dpm/discussions).

We will soon publish instructions for contributing code directly. In the meantime, please use the above methods to communicate your ideas and you can always reach out directly to dicuss further.
